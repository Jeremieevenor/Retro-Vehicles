        <h1>FIND YOUR PERSONAL TREASURE</h1>
        <p>The benefit of buying an outrunning model is the high potential of a valuable investment over a relatively short period of time - cars that are relatively keen today could become valuable classic cars in the future. Other classic cars for sale are already real treasures with a stable value that is permanently rising. Of course, a classic car is not something you park on the street for a longer period of time: Before you purchase your favorite model, you should make sure to have enough space for a long-time storage. If you happen to be lucky enough to find a functioning model, you should regularly maintain the sensitive technique to keep it that way. Spare parts are very expensive and difficult to obtain, so you should try to avoid unnecessary attrition.</p>

                <h3>MERCEDES-BENZ 300 SLR</h3>
                <p> Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Coupé exist, which differ apart from the color of their interior above all also by technical details such as a differently led tank filler neck which is led with the sold, “the red one” called under the trunk lid, with the “blue one” however by the rear window.</p>

                <h3>FERRARI 328 GTS</h3>
                <p>The engine now has a displacement of 3.2 litres – to be precise, it grew from 2,927 cc to 3,185 cc, and with it the power output also increased from 240 to 270 hp. Besides this 12.5 percent increase in power, however, the 17 percent increase in maximum torque 26.5 mkg to 31 mkg seems significant – because it made this engine even more “comfortable”.</p>

                <h3>NISSAN GT-R </h3>
                <p>The Nissan GT-R was launched in 2007 – but the GT-R designation has been around for much longer. In 1964 a rather plain four-door Nissan 2000GT sedan was given a performance kit with the initials GT-R and went head-to-head with a Porsche 904 at the Japanese Grand Prix.</p>
